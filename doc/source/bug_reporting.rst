Reporting bugs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The maintainers wishes to be made aware of any and all bugs. Please
open an issue at the GitHub repository
(https://github.com/flintlib/flint) or send an email with your bug
report to the FLINT devel list
https://groups.google.com/group/flint-devel.


If possible please include details of your system, how Flint was
complied/installed, the versions of GMP/MPIR and MPFR as well as
precise details of how to replicate the bug.

Note that FLINT needs to be linked against version 2.6.0 or later of
MPIR (or version 5.1.1 or later of GMP), version 3.0.0 or later of
MPFR and must be compiled with gcc version 2.96 or later. Version 4.8
or later of GCC is recommended for parallel builds.
