Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This module contains functionality for creating, listing and reducing binary quadratic forms. A ``qfb`` struct consists of three ``fmpz_t`` s, `a`, `b` and `c`, and basic algorithms for operations such as reduction, composition and enumerating are inplemented and described below.

Currently the code only works for definite binary quadratic forms.

Memory management
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. function:: void qfb_init(qfb_t q)

    Initialise a ``qfb_t`` `q` for use.

.. function:: void qfb_clear(qfb_t q)

    Clear a ``qfb_t`` after use. This releases any memory allocated for
    `q` back to flint.

.. function:: void qfb_array_clear(qfb ** forms, slong num)

    Clean up an array of ``qfb`` structs allocated by a qfb function.
    The parameter ``num`` must be set to the length of the array.

Hash table
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. function:: qfb_hash_t * qfb_hash_init(slong depth)
    
    Initialises a hash table of size `2^{depth}`. 

.. function:: void qfb_hash_clear(qfb_hash_t * qhash, slong depth)

    Frees all memory used by a hash table of size `2^{depth}`. 

.. function:: void qfb_hash_insert(qfb_hash_t * qhash, qfb_t q, qfb_t q2, slong iter, slong depth)

    Insert the binary quadratic form ``q`` into the given hash table 
    of size `2^{depth}` in the field ``q`` of the hash structure. 
    Also store the second binary quadratic form ``q2`` (if not 
    ``NULL``) in the similarly named field and ``iter`` in the 
    similarly named field of the hash structure. 

.. function:: slong qfb_hash_find(qfb_hash_t * qhash, qfb_t q, slong depth)

    Search for the given binary quadratic form or its inverse in the 
    given hash table of size `2^{depth}`. If it is found, return
    the index in the table (which is an array of ``qfb_hash_t`` 
    structs), otherwise return ``-1``.

Basic manipulation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. function:: void qfb_set(qfb_t f, qfb_t g)

    Set the binary quadratic form `f` to be equal to `g`.

Comparison
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. function:: int qfb_equal(qfb_t f, qfb_t g)

    Returns `1` if `f` and `g` are identical binary quadratic forms, 
    otherwise returns `0`.

Input/output
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. function:: void qfb_print(qfb_t q)

    Print a binary quadratic form `q` in the format `(a, b, c)` where
    `a`, `b`, `c` are the entries of `q`.

Computing with forms
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. function:: void qfb_discriminant(fmpz_t D, qfb_t f)

    Set `D` to the discriminant of the binary quadratic form `f`, i.e. to
    `b^2 - 4ac`, where `f = (a, b, c)`.

.. function:: void qfb_reduce(qfb_t r, qfb_t f, fmpz_t D)

    Set `r` to a reduced form equivalent to the binary quadratic form `f`
    of discriminant `D`.
    
.. function:: int qfb_is_reduced(qfb_t r)

    Returns `1` if `q` is a reduced binary quadratic form, otherwise
    returns `0`. Note that this only tests for definite quadratic
    forms, so a form `r = (a,b,c)` is reduced if and only if `|b| \le a \le
    c` and if either inequality is an equality, then `b \ge 0`. 

.. function:: slong qfb_reduced_forms(qfb ** forms, slong d)

    Given a discriminant `d` (negative for negative definite forms), compute
    all the reduced binary quadratic forms of that discriminant. The function
    allocates space for these and returns it in the variable ``forms`` 
    (the user is responsible for cleaning this up by a single call to 
    ``qfb_array_clear`` on ``forms``, after use.) The function returns 
    the number of forms generated (the form class number). The forms are 
    stored in an array of ``qfb`` structs, which contain fields 
    ``a, b, c`` corresponding to forms `(a, b, c)`. 

.. function:: slong qfb_reduced_forms_large(qfb ** forms, slong d)

    As for ``qfb_reduced_forms``. However, for small `|d|` it requires 
    fewer primes to be computed at a small cost in speed. It is called 
    automatically by ``qfb_reduced_forms`` for large `|d|` so that 
    ``flint_primes`` is not exhausted.

.. function:: void qfb_nucomp(qfb_t r, const qfb_t f, const qfb_t g, fmpz_t D, fmpz_t L)
    
    Shanks' NUCOMP as described in [JvdP2002]_.

    Computes the near reduced composition of forms `f` and `g` given 
    `L = \lfloor |D|^{1/4} \rfloor` where `D` is the common discriminant of
    `f` and `g`. The result is returned in `r`.

    We require that `f` is a primitive form.

.. function:: void qfb_nudupl(qfb_t r, const qfb_t f, fmpz_t D, fmpz_t L)
   
    As for ``nucomp`` except that the form `f` is composed with itself.
    We require that `f` is a primitive form.

.. function:: void qfb_pow_ui(qfb_t r, qfb_t f, fmpz_t D, ulong exp)

    Compute the near reduced form `r` which is the result of composing the
    principal form (identity) with `f` ``exp`` times. 

    We require `D` to be set to the discriminant of `f` and that `f` is a
    primitive form.

.. function:: void qfb_pow(qfb_t r, qfb_t f, fmpz_t D, fmpz_t exp)

    As per ``qfb_pow_ui``.

.. function:: void qfb_inverse(qfb_t r, qfb_t f)
    
    Set `r` to the inverse of the binary quadratic form `f`.

.. function:: int qfb_is_principal_form(qfb_t f, fmpz_t D)
    
    Return `1` if `f` is the reduced principal form of discriminant `D`,
    i.e. the identity in the form class group, else `0`.

.. function:: void qfb_principal_form(qfb_t f, fmpz_t D)

    Set `f` to the principal form of discriminant `D`, i.e. the identity in
    the form class group.

.. function:: int qfb_is_primitive(qfb_t f)

    Return `1` if `f` is primitive, i.e. the greatest common divisor of its
    three coefficients is `1`. Otherwise the function returns `0`.

.. function:: void qfb_prime_form(qfb_t r, fmpz_t D, fmpz_t p)

    Sets `r` to the unique prime `(p, b, c)` of discriminant `D`, i.e. with
    `0 < b \leq p`. We require that `p` is a prime.

.. function:: int qfb_exponent_element(fmpz_t exponent, qfb_t f, fmpz_t n, ulong B1, ulong B2_sqrt)

    Find the exponent of the element `f` in the form class group of forms of
    discriminant `n`, doing a stage `1` with primes up to at least ``B1`` 
    and a stage `2` for a single large prime up to at least the square of 
    ``B2_sqrt``. If the function fails to find the exponent it returns `0`, 
    otherwise the function returns `1` and ``exponent`` is set to the 
    exponent of `f`, i.e. the minimum power of `f` which gives the identity.

    It is assumed that the form `f` is reduced. We require that ``iters``
    is a power of `2` and that ``iters`` `\ge 1024`.

    The function performs a stage `2` which stores up to `4\times` 
    ``iters`` binary quadratic forms, and `12\times` ``iters``
    additional limbs of data in a hash table, where ``iters`` is the
    square root of ``B2``.

.. function:: int qfb_exponent(fmpz_t exponent, fmpz_t n, ulong B1, ulong B2_sqrt, slong c)

    Compute the exponent of the class group of discriminant `n`, doing
    a stage `1` with primes up to at least ``B1`` and a stage `2` for
    a single large prime up to at least the square of ``B2_sqrt``, and
    with probability at least `1 - 2^{-c}`. If the prime limits are
    exhausted without finding the exponent, the function returns `0`,
    otherwise it returns `1` and ``exponent`` is set to the computed
    exponent, i.e. the minimum power to which every element of the
    class group has to be raised in order to get the identity.

    The function performs a stage `2` which stores up to `4\times` 
    ``iters`` binary quadratic forms, and `12\times` ``iters``
    additional limbs of data in a hash table, where ``iters`` is the
    square root of ``B2``.

    We use algorithm 8.1 of [Sut2007]_.

.. function:: int qfb_exponent_grh(fmpz_t exponent, fmpz_t n, ulong B1, ulong B2_sqrt)

    Similar to ``qfb_exponent`` except that the bound ``c`` is 
    automatically generated such that the exponent is guaranteed to be
    correct, if found, assuming the GRH, namely that the class group is 
    generated by primes less than `6\log^2(|n|)` as described in [BD1992]_.
