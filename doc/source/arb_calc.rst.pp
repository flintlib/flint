**arb_calc.h** -- calculus with real-valued functions
===============================================================================

This module provides functions for operations of calculus
over the real numbers (intended to include root-finding,
optimization, integration, and so on). It is planned that the module
will include two types of algorithms:

* Interval algorithms that give provably correct results. An example
  would be numerical integration on an interval by dividing the
  interval into small balls and evaluating the function
  on each ball, giving rigorous upper and lower bounds.
* Conventional numerical algorithms that use heuristics
  to estimate the accuracy of a result, without guaranteeing
  that it is correct. An example would be numerical integration
  based on pointwise evaluation, where the error is estimated
  by comparing the results with two different sets of evaluation
  points. Ball arithmetic then still tracks the accuracy
  of the function evaluations.

Any algorithms of the second kind will be clearly
marked as such.

Types, macros and constants
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. type:: arb_calc_func_t

    Typedef for a pointer to a function with signature::

        int func(arb_ptr out, const arb_t inp, void * param, slong order, slong prec)

    implementing a univariate real function `f(x)`.
    When called, *func* should write to *out* the first *order*
    coefficients in the Taylor series expansion of `f(x)` at the point *inp*,
    evaluated at a precision of *prec* bits.
    The *param* argument may be used to pass through
    additional parameters to the function.
    The return value is reserved for future use as an
    error code. It can be assumed that *out* and *inp* are not
    aliased and that *order* is positive.

.. macro:: ARB_CALC_SUCCESS

    Return value indicating that an operation is successful.

.. macro:: ARB_CALC_IMPRECISE_INPUT

    Return value indicating that the input to a function probably needs
    to be computed more accurately.

.. macro:: ARB_CALC_NO_CONVERGENCE

    Return value indicating that an algorithm has failed to convergence,
    possibly due to the problem not having a solution, the algorithm
    not being applicable, or the precision being insufficient

Debugging
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. var:: int arb_calc_verbose

    If set, enables printing information about the calculation
    to standard output.


Subdivision-based root finding
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. type:: arf_interval_struct

.. type:: arf_interval_t

    An :type:`arf_interval_struct` consists of a pair of :type:`arf_struct`,
    representing an interval used for subdivision-based root-finding.
    An :type:`arf_interval_t` is defined as an array of length one of type
    :type:`arf_interval_struct`, permitting an :type:`arf_interval_t` 
    to be passed by reference.

.. type:: arf_interval_ptr

   Alias for ``arf_interval_struct *``, used for vectors of intervals.

.. type:: arf_interval_srcptr

   Alias for ``const arf_interval_struct *``, used for vectors of intervals.

.. function:: void arf_interval_init(arf_interval_t v)

.. function:: void arf_interval_clear(arf_interval_t v)

.. function:: arf_interval_ptr _arf_interval_vec_init(slong n)

.. function:: void _arf_interval_vec_clear(arf_interval_ptr v, slong n)

.. function:: void arf_interval_set(arf_interval_t v, const arf_interval_t u)

.. function:: void arf_interval_swap(arf_interval_t v, arf_interval_t u)

.. function:: void arf_interval_get_arb(arb_t x, const arf_interval_t v, slong prec)

.. function:: void arf_interval_printd(const arf_interval_t v, slong n)

    Helper functions for endpoint-based intervals.

.. function:: void arf_interval_fprintd(FILE * file, const arf_interval_t v, slong n)

    Helper functions for endpoint-based intervals.

.. function:: slong arb_calc_isolate_roots(arf_interval_ptr * found, int ** flags, arb_calc_func_t func, void * param, const arf_interval_t interval, slong maxdepth, slong maxeval, slong maxfound, slong prec)

    Rigorously isolates single roots of a real analytic function
    on the interior of an interval.

    This routine writes an array of *n* interesting subintervals of
    *interval* to *found* and corresponding flags to *flags*, returning the integer *n*.
    The output has the following properties:

    * The function has no roots on *interval* outside of the output
      subintervals.

    * Subintervals are sorted in increasing order (with no overlap except
      possibly starting and ending with the same point).

    * Subintervals with a flag of 1 contain exactly one (single) root.

    * Subintervals with any other flag may or may not contain roots.

    If no flags other than 1 occur, all roots of the function on *interval*
    have been isolated. If there are output subintervals on which the
    existence or nonexistence of roots could not be determined,
    the user may attempt further searches on those subintervals
    (possibly with increased precision and/or increased
    bounds for the breaking criteria). Note that roots of multiplicity
    higher than one and roots located exactly at endpoints cannot be isolated
    by the algorithm.

    The following breaking criteria are implemented:

    * At most *maxdepth* recursive subdivisions are attempted. The smallest
      details that can be distinguished are therefore about
      `2^{-\text{maxdepth}}` times the width of *interval*.
      A typical, reasonable value might be between 20 and 50.

    * If the total number of tested subintervals exceeds *maxeval*, the
      algorithm is terminated and any untested subintervals are added
      to the output. The total number of calls to *func* is thereby restricted
      to a small multiple of *maxeval* (the actual count can be slightly
      higher depending on implementation details).
      A typical, reasonable value might be between 100 and 100000.

    * The algorithm terminates if *maxfound* roots have been isolated.
      In particular, setting *maxfound* to 1 can be used to locate
      just one root of the function even if there are numerous roots.
      To try to find all roots, *LONG_MAX* may be passed.

    The argument *prec* denotes the precision used to evaluate the
    function. It is possibly also used for some other arithmetic operations
    performed internally by the algorithm. Note that it probably does not
    make sense for *maxdepth* to exceed *prec*.

    Warning: it is assumed that subdivision points of *interval* can be
    represented exactly as floating-point numbers in memory.
    Do not pass `1 \pm 2^{-10^{100}}` as input.

.. function:: int arb_calc_refine_root_bisect(arf_interval_t r, arb_calc_func_t func, void * param, const arf_interval_t start, slong iter, slong prec)

    Given an interval *start* known to contain a single root of *func*,
    refines it using *iter* bisection steps. The algorithm can
    return a failure code if the sign of the function at an evaluation
    point is ambiguous. The output *r* is set to a valid isolating interval
    (possibly just *start*) even if the algorithm fails.

Newton-based root finding
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. function:: void arb_calc_newton_conv_factor(arf_t conv_factor, arb_calc_func_t func, void * param, const arb_t conv_region, slong prec)

    Given an interval `I` specified by *conv_region*, evaluates a bound
    for `C = \sup_{t,u \in I} \frac{1}{2} |f''(t)| / |f'(u)|`,
    where `f` is the function specified by *func* and *param*.
    The bound is obtained by evaluating `f'(I)` and `f''(I)` directly.
    If `f` is ill-conditioned, `I` may need to be extremely precise in
    order to get an effective, finite bound for *C*.

.. function:: int arb_calc_newton_step(arb_t xnew, arb_calc_func_t func, void * param, const arb_t x, const arb_t conv_region, const arf_t conv_factor, slong prec)

    Performs a single step with an interval version of Newton's method.
    The input consists of the function `f` specified
    by *func* and *param*, a ball `x = [m-r, m+r]` known
    to contain a single root of `f`, a ball `I` (*conv_region*)
    containing `x` with an associated bound (*conv_factor*) for
    `C = \sup_{t,u \in I} \frac{1}{2} |f''(t)| / |f'(u)|`,
    and a working precision *prec*.

    The Newton update consists of setting
    `x' = [m'-r', m'+r']` where `m' = m - f(m) / f'(m)`
    and `r' = C r^2`. The expression `m - f(m) / f'(m)` is evaluated
    using ball arithmetic at a working precision of *prec* bits, and the
    rounding error during this evaluation is accounted for in the output.
    We now check that `x' \in I` and `r' < r`. If both conditions are
    satisfied, we set *xnew* to `x'` and return *ARB_CALC_SUCCESS*.
    If either condition fails, we set *xnew* to `x` and return
    *ARB_CALC_NO_CONVERGENCE*, indicating that no progress
    is made.

.. function:: int arb_calc_refine_root_newton(arb_t r, arb_calc_func_t func, void * param, const arb_t start, const arb_t conv_region, const arf_t conv_factor, slong eval_extra_prec, slong prec)

    Refines a precise estimate of a single root of a function
    to high precision by performing several Newton steps, using
    nearly optimally chosen doubling precision steps.

    The inputs are defined as for *arb_calc_newton_step*, except for
    the precision parameters: *prec* is the target accuracy and
    *eval_extra_prec* is the estimated number of guard bits that need
    to be added to evaluate the function accurately close to the root
    (for example, if the function is a polynomial with large coefficients
    of alternating signs and Horner's rule is used to evaluate it,
    the extra precision should typically be approximately
    the bit size of the coefficients).

    This function returns *ARB_CALC_SUCCESS* if all attempted
    Newton steps are successful (note that this does not guarantee
    that the computed root is accurate to *prec* bits, which has
    to be verified by the user), only that it is more accurate
    than the starting ball.

    On failure, *ARB_CALC_IMPRECISE_INPUT*
    or *ARB_CALC_NO_CONVERGENCE* may be returned. In this case, *r*
    is set to a ball for the root which is valid but likely
    does have full accuracy (it can possibly just be equal
    to the starting ball).
