Allocation Functions
-----------------------------------------------

.. function::  void * flint_malloc(size_t size)

   Allocate ``size`` bytes of memory.

.. function::  void * flint_realloc(void * ptr, size_t size)

   Reallocate an area of memory previously allocated by :func:`flint_malloc`,
   :func:`flint_realloc`, or :func:`flint_calloc`.

.. function::  void * flint_calloc(size_t num, size_t size)

   Allocate ``num`` objects of ``size`` bytes each, and zero the allocated memory.

.. function ::   void flint_free(void * ptr)       

   Free a section of memory allocated by  :func:`flint_malloc`,
   :func:`flint_realloc`, or :func:`flint_calloc`.

Random Numbers
------------------

.. type:: flint_rand_struct

    A structure holding the state of a flint pseudo random number generator.

.. type:: flint_rand_t

    An array of length 1 of :type:`flint_rand_struct`.

.. type:: flint_rand_ptr

    Pointer to a :type:`flint_rand_struct`.

.. function:: flint_rand_ptr flint_rand_alloc()

    Allocates a ``flint_rand_t`` object to be used like a heap-allocated
    ``flint_rand_t`` in external libraries.
    The random state is not initialised.

.. function:: void flint_rand_free(flint_rand_ptr state)
   
    Frees a random state object as allocated using :func:`flint_rand_alloc`.


.. function:: void flint_randinit(flint_rand_t state)

    Initialize a :type:`flint_rand_t`.

.. function:: void flint_randclear(flint_rand_t state)

    Free all memory allocated by :func:`flint_rand_init`.

Thread functions
-----------------------

.. function:: void flint_set_num_threads(int num_threads)

    Set up a thread pool of ``num_threads - 1`` worker threads (in addition
    to the master thread) and set the maximum number of worker threads the
    master thread can start to ``num_threads - 1``.

    This function may only be called globally from the master thread. It can
    also be called at a global level to change the size of the thread pool, but
    an exception is raised if the thread pool is in use (threads have been
    woken but not given back). The function cannot be called from inside
    worker threads.

.. function:: void flint_get_num_threads()

    When called at the global level, this function returns one more than the
    number of worker threads in the Flint thread pool, i.e. it counts the
    workers in the thread pool plus one more for the master thread.

    In general, this function returns one more than the number of additional
    worker threads that can be started by the current thread.

    Use :func:`thread_pool_wake` to set this number for a given worker thread.

.. function:: int flint_set_num_workers(int num_workers)

    Restricts the number of worker threads that can be started by the current
    thread to ``num_workers``. This function can be called from any thread.

    Assumes that the Flint thread pool is already set up.

    The function returns the old number of worker threads that can be started.
    
    The function can only be used to reduce the number of workers that can be
    started from a thread. It cannot be used to increase the number. If a
    higher number is passed, the function has no effect.

    The number of workers must be restored to the original value by a call to
    :func:`flint_reset_num_workers` before the thread is returned to the thread
    pool.

    The main use of this function and :func:`flint_reset_num_workers` is to cheaply
    and temporarily restrict the number of workers that can be started, e.g. by
    a function that one wishes to call from a thread, and cheaply restore the
    number of workers to its original value before exiting the current thread.

.. function:: void flint_reset_num_workers(int num_workers)

    After a call to :func:`flint_set_num_workers` this function must be called to
    set the number of workers that may be started by the current thread back to
    its original value.

Input/Output
-----------------

.. function::  int flint_printf(const char * str, ...)
               int flint_vprintf(const char * str, va_list ap)
               int flint_fprintf(FILE * f, const char * str, ...)
               int flint_sprintf(char * s, const char * str, ...)

    These are equivalent to the standard library functions ``printf``,
    ``vprintf``, ``fprintf``, and ``sprintf`` with an additional length modifier
    "w" for use with an :type:`mp_limb_t` type. This modifier can be used with
    format specifiers "d", "x", or "u", thereby outputting the limb as a signed
    decimal, hexadecimal, or unsigned decimal integer.

           
.. function::  int flint_scanf(const char * str, ...)
               int flint_fscanf(FILE * f, const char * str, ...)
               int flint_sscanf(const char * s, const char * str, ...)

     These are equivalent to the standard library functions ``scanf``,
     ``fscanf``, and ``sscanf`` with an additional length modifier "w" for
     reading an :type:`mp_limb_t` type.
