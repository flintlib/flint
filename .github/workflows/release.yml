# This workflow takes care of creating release archives for the
# Flint distribution. It is run for all PR and branch pushes as usual,
# but also on tags whose name starts with `vX.Y` with X, Y numbers
# (the idea is to use v1.2.3 or v1.2.3-beta3)
#
# For builds triggered by a tag, the tag is turned into a GitHub release and
# the produced archives are attached to that.
