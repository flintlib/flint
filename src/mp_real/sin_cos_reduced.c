/* _mp_real_sin_cos_reduced: sin(t) and g = 1 - cos(t) of a reduced
   argument t < 2^-r, r >= 16 (the series algorithms 1 and 2 require
   r >= 32), into (ysin, wn) and (yg, wn) -- wn fraction limbs each;
   sin(t) < 2^-r and g < 2^(-2r-1), so neither carries a units limb,
   though both buffers must have room for wn + 1 limbs (the top limb
   is scratch).  This is the trigonometric analogue of
   _mp_real_exp_reduced, independent of any particular
   argument-reduction scheme (the tangent half-angle reconstruction
   consumes exactly this pair).

   alg selects the method:
       0  the tuned automatic choice
       1  the direct sine + cosine rectangular-splitting series
       2  the sine rectangular-splitting series plus a squaring and
          a square root (the "sin sqrt" trick: the odd series has
          half the terms, and g = 1 - sqrt(1 - sin^2))
       3  one bit-burst step -- t = x1 + x2 with x1 the leading
          slice down to the tripled first limb boundary and x2 below
          it -- combining exp(i x1) from the Gaussian mpn binary
          splitting with exp(i x2) from the tuned series at the
          raised rate
       4  the full bit-burst algorithm: exp(i t) = prod_k exp(i x_k)
          with slice lengths TRIPLING on limb boundaries, each
          factor from the Gaussian binary splitting; asymptotically
          quasi-optimal for very large wn (or very large r)

   The burst mirrors _mp_real_exp_reduced at LIMB granularity: the
   boundary ladder is a list of limb counts (tripling), a slice is a
   pointer + length into t with a whole-limb mask, dead low limbs of
   a slice fold into its frame (u B^-D = (u/B^z) B^-(D-z)), and each
   slice's factor is the exact Gaussian rational

       exp(i x_k) ~ (Q_k B^{QE_k} - A_k + i B_k) / (Q_k B^{QE_k})

   truncated at N_k series terms, all exponents limb counts.
   Instead of combining per level, the complex numerator
   NUM = prod (Q_k B^{QE_k} - A_k + i B_k) and the real denominator
   DEN = prod Q_k are product trees of balls at wn + 3 limbs (one
   transform-sharing complex product per node, mp_real_mul_complex),
   and the finish is TWO ball divisions (sine and cosine) against the
   single accumulated denominator -- where arb_sin_cos_arf_bb spends one full-precision
   square root PER SLICE (cos_k from sin_k) plus a full-precision
   complex product tree.  g comes from the cosine by subtraction:
   the ~2r-bit cancellation is harmless because g is only needed to
   absolute 2^(-64 wn), like the direct series path.  The bounds are
   rigorous, checked against SIN_COS_REDUCED_MAX_ERR = 96 ulps
   on export: 1 ulp for the burst variants, and the series kernels'
   own for the sine + sqrt path.  The series remainder of the
   one-step variant runs one guard limb deeper than the output, as in
   _mp_real_exp_reduced: multiplied into the product of the slice
   factors, its radius is requantized at a coarser limb anchor
   (up to three times per level), which without the guard limb
   compounded to 70 ulps (5901 limbs, r = 31).  An earlier driver in
   hand-written mpn arithmetic (windowed middle products, limb
   frames, flint_mpn_mulhigh_n_complex, an informal error accounting)
   measured the same speed phase for phase and was dropped. */

#define TRIG_BURST_GUARD 3

/* Thresholds measured on the development VM (terms = 64 wn / r;
   sweeps in dev/notes), after the per-slice square-root hybrid and
   the truncated trees.  The sqrt-trick crossover carries over the
   50-term value the tangent half-angle code was tuned to (measured
   ~24-48 here, margins of a few percent).  The one-burst-step
   crossover is strongly r-dependent: at r < 64 a single step
   halves a LONG series and wins from ~256-384 terms, while for
   r >= 64 the splitting integers' fat terms push it to ~2048-3072.
   The one-step variant CASCADES: its series remainder runs at the
   tripled rate and redispatches, so below the full-burst threshold
   the effective algorithm is a few burst slices finished by
   rectangular splitting once the remaining series is short -- and
   that hybrid beats the full bit-burst (and arb_sin_cos_arf_bb) by
   1.2-1.3x in the 1e5-4e6 bit range.  The full burst only draws
   level from ~4e5 series terms (~1e7 bits at r = 24; measured at
   r = 24 and r = 32, the terms crossover agreeing), so a single
   high threshold covers all r; the tuning is self-referential
   (each threshold change alters the cascade being measured) and
   these values are the fixed point of that iteration on the
   development VM.

   Re-swept for r >= 64 on the fft_small build over n = 256 .. 15625
   limbs and r = 32 .. 768 (the diophantine (multi-prime) reduction of
   sin_cos_diophantine.c lands at r ~ 100-300): the one-step crossover
   in terms/r grows slowly with n -- about 500 at 512 limbs, 800 at
   1024, 1300 at 2677, 1500 at 6000, below 1950 at 15625 -- so the
   earlier 2560 sat above it at every size from 1024 limbs up,
   choosing the sine+sqrt path in a band where the burst step is
   5-25% faster.  1500 is the single constant that makes the right
   call at 2677, 6000 and 15625 limbs and costs about 6% in one cell
   at 1024 limbs, r = 96; it brings sin_cos_diophantine's default at
   640k bits from 57.8 to 45.2 ms and its 13-prime configuration at
   171k bits from 13.0 to 10.9 ms.  The target machine's
   tune-sin-cos-reduced (wn = 16 .. 131072, r = 16 .. 4096) puts the
   same crossover in (1365, 2048] for every r >= 64, consistent with
   1500, and (256, 512] at r = 32, consistent with 320. */
