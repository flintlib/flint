/* ASM_L gives a local label for a gcc asm block, for use when temporary
   local labels like "1:" might not be available, which is the case for
   instance on the x86s (the SCO assembler doesn't support them).

   The label generated is made unique by including "%=" which is a unique
   number for each insn.  This ensures the same name can be used in multiple
   asm blocks, perhaps via a macro.  Since jumps between asm blocks are not
   allowed there's no need for a label to be usable outside a single
   block.  */
