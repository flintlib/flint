    which are assumed to have space for \code{output_limbs + 1} limbs per

                 mp_size_t n, mp_bitcnt_t w, mp_limb_t ** t1, mp_limb_t ** t2)

    The radix 2 DIF FFT works as follows:

    Input: \code{[i0, i1, ..., i(m-1)]}, for $m = 2n$ a power of $2$.

    Output: \code{[r0, r1, ..., r(m-1)]}\\ \code{ = FFT[i0, i1, ..., i(m-1)]}.

    Algorithm:

    $\bullet$ Recursively compute \code{[r0, r2, r4, ...., r(m-2)]}\\
         \code{= FFT[i0+i(m/2), i1+i(m/2+1), ..., i(m/2-1)+i(m-1)]}

    $\bullet$ Let \code{[t0, t1, ..., t(m/2-1)]}\\
         \code{= [i0-i(m/2), i1-i(m/2+1), ..., i(m/2-1)-i(m-1)]}

    $\bullet$ Let \code{[u0, u1, ..., u(m/2-1)]}\\
         \code{= [z1^0*t0, z1^1*t1, ..., z1^(m/2-1)*t(m/2-1)]}
         where \code{z1 = exp(2*Pi*I/m)} corresponds to multiplication
         by $2^w$.

    $\bullet$ Recursively compute \code{[r1, r3, ..., r(m-1)]}\\
         \code{= FFT[u0, u1, ..., u(m/2-1)]}

    The parameters are as follows:

    $\bullet$ \code{2*n} is the length of the input and output
         arrays

    $\bullet$ $w$ is such that $2^w$ is an $2n$-th root of unity
         in the ring $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ that we are working in,
         i.e. $p = 2^{wn} + 1$ (here $n$ is divisible by
         \code{GMP_LIMB_BITS})

    $\bullet$ \code{ii} is the array of inputs (each input is an
         array of limbs of length \code{wn/GMP_LIMB_BITS + 1} (the
         extra limbs being a "carry limb"). Outputs are written
         in-place.

    We require $nw$ to be at least 64 and the two temporary space pointers to
    point to blocks of size \code{n*w + FLINT_BITS} bits.

void fft_truncate(mp_limb_t ** ii,  mp_size_t n, mp_bitcnt_t w,
                            mp_limb_t ** t1, mp_limb_t ** t2, mp_size_t trunc)

    As for \code{fft_radix2} except that only the first \code{trunc}
    coefficients of the output are computed and the input is regarded as
    having (implied) zero coefficients from coefficient \code{trunc} onwards.
    The coefficients must exist as the algorithm needs to use this extra
    space, but their value is irrelevant. The value of \code{trunc} must be
    divisible by 2.

void fft_truncate1(mp_limb_t ** ii, mp_size_t n, mp_bitcnt_t w,

    As for \code{fft_radix2} except that only the first \code{trunc}
    coefficients of the output are computed. The transform still needs all
    $2n$ input coefficients to be specified.

void ifft_radix2(mp_limb_t ** ii,
                 mp_size_t n, mp_bitcnt_t w, mp_limb_t ** t1, mp_limb_t ** t2)

    The radix 2 DIF IFFT works as follows:

    Input: \code{[i0, i1, ..., i(m-1)]}, for $m = 2n$ a power of $2$.

    Output: \code{[r0, r1, ..., r(m-1)]}\\
            \code{ = IFFT[i0, i1, ..., i(m-1)]}.

    Algorithm:

    $\bullet$ Recursively compute \code{[s0, s1, ...., s(m/2-1)]}\\
         \code{= IFFT[i0, i2, ..., i(m-2)]}

    $\bullet$ Recursively compute \code{[t(m/2), t(m/2+1), ..., t(m-1)]}\\
         \code{= IFFT[i1, i3, ..., i(m-1)]}

    $\bullet$ Let \code{[r0, r1, ..., r(m/2-1)]}\\
         \code{= [s0+z1^0*t0, s1+z1^1*t1, ..., s(m/2-1)+z1^(m/2-1)*t(m/2-1)]}
         where \code{z1 = exp(-2*Pi*I/m)} corresponds to division by $2^w$.

    $\bullet$ Let \code{[r(m/2), r(m/2+1), ..., r(m-1)]}\\
        \code{= [s0-z1^0*t0, s1-z1^1*t1, ..., s(m/2-1)-z1^(m/2-1)*t(m/2-1)]}

    The parameters are as follows:

    $\bullet$ \code{2*n} is the length of the input and output
        arrays

    $\bullet$ $w$ is such that $2^w$ is an $2n$-th root of unity
        in the ring $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ that we are working in,
        i.e. $p = 2^{wn} + 1$ (here $n$ is divisible by
        \code{GMP_LIMB_BITS})

    $\bullet$ \code{ii} is the array of inputs (each input is an
        array of limbs of length \code{wn/GMP_LIMB_BITS + 1} (the
        extra limbs being a "carry limb"). Outputs are written
        in-place.

    We require $nw$ to be at least 64 and the two temporary space pointers
    to point to blocks of size \code{n*w + FLINT_BITS} bits.

void ifft_truncate(mp_limb_t ** ii, mp_size_t n, mp_bitcnt_t w,
                            mp_limb_t ** t1, mp_limb_t ** t2, mp_size_t trunc)

    As for \code{ifft_radix2} except that the output is assumed to have
    zeros from coefficient trunc onwards and only the first trunc
    coefficients of the input are specified. The remaining coefficients need
    to exist as the extra space is needed, but their value is irrelevant.
    The value of \code{trunc} must be divisible by 2.

    Although the implementation does not require it, we assume for simplicity
    that \code{trunc} is greater than $n$. The algorithm begins by computing
    the inverse transform of the first $n$ coefficients of the input array.
    The unspecified coefficients of the second half of the array are then
    written: coefficient \code{trunc + i} is computed as a twist of
    coefficient \code{i} by a root of unity. The values of these coefficients
    are then equal to what they would have been if the inverse transform of
    the right hand side of the input array had been computed with full data
    from the start. The function \code{ifft_truncate1} is then called on the
    entire right half of the input array with this auxilliary data filled in.
    Finally a single layer of the IFFT is completed on all the coefficients
    up to \code{trunc} being careful to note that this involves doubling the
    coefficients from \code{trunc - n} up to \code{n}.

void ifft_truncate1(mp_limb_t ** ii, mp_size_t n, mp_bitcnt_t w,
                            mp_limb_t ** t1, mp_limb_t ** t2, mp_size_t trunc)

    Computes the first \code{trunc} coefficients of the radix 2 inverse
    transform assuming the first \code{trunc} coefficients are given and that
    the remaining coefficients have been set to the value they would have if
    an inverse transform had already been applied with full data.

    The algorithm is the same as for \code{ifft_truncate} except that the
    coefficients from \code{trunc} onwards after the inverse transform are
    not inferred to be zero but the supplied values.

void fft_butterfly_sqrt2(mp_limb_t * s, mp_limb_t * t,
                         mp_limb_t * i1, mp_limb_t * i2, mp_size_t i, 
                             mp_size_t limbs, mp_bitcnt_t w, mp_limb_t * temp)

    Let $w = 2k + 1$, $i = 2j + 1$. Set \code{s = i1 + i2}, 
    \code{t = z1^i*(i1 - i2)} modulo \code{B^limbs + 1} where 
    \code{z1^2 = exp(Pi*I/n)} corresponds to multiplication by $2^w$. Requires 
    $0 \leq i < 2n$ where $nw =$ \code{limbs*FLINT_BITS}.

    Here \code{z1} corresponds to multiplication by $2^k$ then multiplication
    by\\ \code{(2^(3nw/4) - 2^(nw/4))}. We see \code{z1^i} corresponds to
    multiplication by \code{(2^(3nw/4) - 2^(nw/4))*2^(j+ik)}.

    We first multiply by \code{2^(j + ik + wn/4)} then multiply by an
    additional \code{2^(nw/2)} and subtract.

void ifft_butterfly_sqrt2(mp_limb_t * s, mp_limb_t * t, mp_limb_t * i1, 
                              mp_limb_t * i2, mp_size_t i, mp_size_t limbs, 
                                              mp_bitcnt_t w, mp_limb_t * temp)

    Let $w = 2k + 1$, $i = 2j + 1$. Set \code{s = i1 + z1^i*i2},
    \code{t = i1 - z1^i*i2} modulo \code{B^limbs + 1} where 
    \code{z1^2 = exp(-Pi*I/n)} corresponds to division by $2^w$. Requires 
    $0 \leq i < 2n$ where $nw =$ \code{limbs*FLINT_BITS}.

    Here \code{z1} corresponds to division by $2^k$ then division by

    by \code{(2^(3nw/4) - 2^(nw/4))*2^(j+ik)} which is the same as division 
    by \code{2^(j+ik + 1)} then multiplication by 
    \code{(2^(3nw/4) - 2^(nw/4))}.

    Of course, division by \code{2^(j+ik + 1)} is the same as multiplication 
    by \code{2^(2*wn - j - ik - 1)}. The exponent is positive as 
    $i \leq 2*n$, $j < n$, $k < w/2$.

    We first multiply by \code{2^(2*wn - j - ik - 1 + wn/4)} then multiply by 
    an additional \code{2^(nw/2)} and subtract.

    As per \code{fft_truncate} except that the transform is twice the usual 
    length, i.e. length $4n$ rather than $2n$. This is achieved by making use 
    of twiddles by powers of a square root of 2, not powers of 2 in the first 
    layer of the transform.  

    We require $nw$ to be at least 64 and the three temporary space pointers 
    to point to blocks of size \code{n*w + FLINT_BITS} bits.

                             mp_limb_t ** temp, mp_size_t n1, mp_size_t trunc)

    This is as per the \code{fft_truncate_sqrt2} function except that the 
    matrix fourier algorithm is used for the left and right FFTs. The total 
    transform length is $4n$ where \code{n = 2^depth} so that the left and
    right transforms are both length $2n$. We require \code{trunc > 2*n} and
    that \code{trunc} is divisible by \code{2*n1} (explained below).

    The matrix fourier algorithm, which is applied to each transform of length
    $2n$, works as follows. We set \code{n1} to a power of 2 about the square
    root of $n$. The data is then thought of as a set of \code{n2} rows each
    with \code{n1} columns (so that \code{n1*n2 = 2n}). 

    The length $2n$ transform is then computed using a whole pile of short 
    transforms. These comprise \code{n1} column transforms of length \code{n2}
    followed by some twiddles by roots of unity (namely \code{z^rc} where $r$ 
    is the row and $c$ the column within the data) followed by \code{n2}
    row transforms of length \code{n1}. Along the way the data needs to be
    rearranged due to the fact that the short transforms output the data in 
    binary reversed order compared with what is needed.

    The matrix fourier algorithm provides better cache locality by decomposing
    the long length $2n$ transforms into many transforms of about the square 
    root of the original length. 

    For better cache locality the sqrt2 layer of the full length $4n$ 
    transform is folded in with the column FFTs performed as part of the first 
    matrix fourier algorithm on the left half of the data.

    The second half of the data requires a truncated version of the matrix
    fourier algorithm. This is achieved by truncating to an exact multiple of 
    the row length so that the row transforms are full length. Moreover, the 
    column transforms will then be truncated transforms and their truncated 
    length needs to be a multiple of 2. This explains the condition on 
    \code{trunc} given above. 

    To improve performance, the extra twiddles by roots of unity are combined
    with the butterflies performed at the last layer of the column transforms.

    We require $nw$ to be at least 64 and the three temporary space pointers 
    to point to blocks of size \code{n*w + FLINT_BITS} bits.

                             mp_limb_t ** temp, mp_size_t n1, mp_size_t trunc)

    This is as per the \code{ifft_truncate_sqrt2} function except that the 
    matrix fourier algorithm is used for the left and right IFFTs. The total 
    transform length is $4n$ where \code{n = 2^depth} so that the left and
    right transforms are both length $2n$. We require \code{trunc > 2*n} and
    that \code{trunc} is divisible by \code{2*n1}.

    We set \code{n1} to a power of 2 about the square root of $n$.

    As per the matrix fourier FFT the sqrt2 layer is folded into the the 
    final column IFFTs for better cache locality and the extra twiddles that 
    occur in the matrix fourier algorithm are combined with the butterflied 
    performed at the first layer of the final column transforms.
