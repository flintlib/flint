FLINT has been developed since 2007 by a large number of people. Initially
the library was started by David Harvey and William Hart. Later maintenance
of the library was taken over solely by William Hart.

We list here just the *main* authors of Flint whose contributions have been
in the tens of thousands of lines of code:

William Hart -- integer and polynomial arithmetic, factorisation and
primality testing, general infrastructure (supported by EPSRC Grant
EP/G004870/1, DFG Priority programme SPP1489 and the DFG TRR 195 SFB Grant)

Sebastian Pancratz -- polynomial arithmetic over Z, Z/n\Z and Q, p-adic and
q-adic arithmetic, including polynomials and matrices (supported by ERC
Grant 204083)

Andy Novocin -- LLL, polynomial factorisation over Z, polynomial
composition

Fredrik Johansson -- matrices, polynomial and power series arithmetic,
special functions (supported by Austrian Science Fund FWF Grant Y464-N18)

Tom Bachmann -- C++ expressions template wrapper, documentation parser
(Google Summer of Code 2013)

Mike Hansen -- Finite fields (small and large F_q), polynomials/matrices
over F_q, Finite fields with Zech logarithm representation, Fast
factorisation of polynomials over F_q (supported by Macaulay2 developers
NSF Grant 1002171)

Daniel Schultz -- Multivariate polynomials over Z, Z/nZ, Q and F_q, including
parallel implementations.
