FLINT has been developed since 2007 by a large number of people. Initially
the library was started by David Harvey and William Hart. Later maintenance
of the library was taken over solely by William Hart.

The authors of FLINT to date:

$\bullet$ William Hart -- integer and polynomial arithmetic, factorisation and
primality testing, general infrastructure (supported by EPSRC Grant
EP/G004870/1 and DFG Priority programme SPP1489)

$\bullet$ Sebastian Pancratz -- polynomial arithmetic over $\Z$, $\Z/n\Z$ and
$\Q$, $p$-adic and $q$-adic arithmetic, including polynomials and matrices
(supported by ERC Grant 204083)

$\bullet$ Andy Novocin -- LLL, polynomial factorisation over $Z$, polynomial
composition

$\bullet$ Fredrik Johansson -- matrices, polynomial and power series
arithmetic, special functions (supported by Austrian Science Fund FWF Grant
Y464-N18)

$\bullet$ Tom Bachmann -- \code{C++} expressions template wrapper,
documentation parser (Google Summer of Code 2013)

$\bullet$ Mike Hansen -- Finite fields (small and large $\F_q$),
polynomials/matrices over $\F_q$, Finite fields with Zech logarithm
representation, Fast factorisation of polynomials over $\F_q$ (supported by
Macaulay2 developers NSF Grant 1002171)

$\bullet$ Martin Lee -- Fast factorisation of polynomials over $\Z/n\Z$,
faster Brent-Kung modular composition

$\bullet$ David Harvey -- Fast Fourier Transform code, \code{zn_poly} for
polynomial arithmetic over $\Z/n\Z$, \code{mpz_poly}, profiling and
graphing code and many other parts of the FLINT library

$\bullet$ Jan Tuitman -- helped with the $p$-adic interface

$\bullet$ Jason Papadopoulos -- Block Lanczos code for quadratic sieve and
multiprecision complex root finding code for polynomials.

$\bullet$ Gonzalo Tornaria -- Theta function module, Montgomery multiplication
and significant contributions to the $\Z[x]$ modular multiplication code.

$\bullet$ Burcin Erocal -- wrote the primary FLINT wrapper in the SAGE system
(Robert Bradshaw also wrote a preliminary version of this and Martin Albrecht
and others have also contributed to it.)  Burcin also contributed by writing
grant applications via his Lmonade organisation to Google. (Supported by DFG
Priority programme SPP1489.)

$\bullet$ Tom Boothby -- Improved factoring of unsigned longs, detection of
perfect powers

$\bullet$ Andres Goens -- $\F_q$ module and polynomials over $\F_q$ (supported
by DFG Priority program SPP1489)

$\bullet$ Lina Kulakova --  factorisation for polynomials over $\F_p$ for large
$p$ (Google Summer of Code 2012)

$\bullet$ Thomas DuBuisson -- logical ops for fmpz module, patches to the build
system

$\bullet$ Jean-Pierre Flori -- many build system patches and Sage integration

$\bullet$ Frithjof Schulze -- some fmpz functions and various patches

$\bullet$ Curtis Bright -- numerous patches including 32 bit support

$\bullet$ Daniel Woodhouse -- Contributed an implementation of multivariate
multiplication over $\Z/n\Z$ and used this to implement a fast ``saturation''
algorithm for Laurent polynomials. (Funded by Alessio Corti and Tom Coates
at Imperial College)

$\bullet$ Tomasz Lechowski -- Contributed some NTL and Pari polynomial
profiling code and researched algorithms for polynomials over finite fields.
(Funded by the Nuffield Foundation)

$\bullet$ Daniel Scott -- Researched lazy and relaxed algorithms of Joris van
der Hoeven. (Funded by Warwick University's Undergraduate Research Scholars
Scheme)

$\bullet$ David Howden -- Wrote code for computing Bernoulli numbers mod many
primes, including fast polynomial multiplication over $\Z/p\Z$ specifically for
the task. (Funded by Warwick University's Undergraduate Research Scholars
Scheme)

$\bullet$ Daniel Ellam -- Helped design a module for $p$-adic arithmetic for
FLINT. (Funded by Warwick University's Undergraduate Research Scholars Scheme)

$\bullet$ Richard Howell-Peak -- Wrote polynomial factorisation and
irreducibility testing code for polynomials over $\Z/p\Z$. (Funded by Warwick
University's Undergraduate Research Scholars Scheme)

$\bullet$ Peter Shrimpton -- Wrote code for a basic prime sieve,
Pocklington-Lehmer, Lucas, Fibonacci, BSPW and $n-1$ primality tests and a
Weiferich prime search. (Funded by the Nuffield Foundation)

$\bullet$ Dana Jacobsen -- test BPSW primality code up to $2^64$ against
Feitma's tables and sped up and corrected \code{n_is_prime} and
\code{n_is_probabprime}.

$\bullet$ Patches and bug reports have been made by Michael Abshoff, 
Didier Deshommes, Craig Citro, Timothy Abbot, Carl Witty, Gonzalo Tornaria,
Jaap Spies, Kiran Kedlaya, William Stein, Kate Minola, Didier Deshommes, Robert
Bradshaw, Serge Torres, Dan Grayson, Martin Lee, Bob Smith, Antony Vennard,
Fr\'{e}d\'{e}ric Chyzak, Julien Puydt, Dana Jacobsen, Michael Jacobson Jr.,
Mike Stillman, Jan Englehardt, Jean-Pierre Flori, Jeroen Demeyer, Shi Bai,
Qingwen Guan, Frithjof Schulze, Robert Baillie, Oleksandr Motsak, Hans
Schoenemann, Janko Boehm, Ahmed Soliman, Francois Bissey, Anton Mellit
and others.

$\bullet$ In addition Michael Abshoff, William Stein and Robert Bradshaw have
contributed to the build system of FLINT.

$\bullet$ Michael Abshoff deserves special recognition for his help in
resolving a number of difficult build issues which came to light as FLINT was
incorporated into SAGE and for bringing numerous bugs to the attention of the
FLINT maintainers. Michael regularly checked FLINT for memory leaks and
corruption, which directly led to numerous issues being identified early!
He also helped with setting up various pieces of infrastructure for the FLINT
project.

$\bullet$ Numerous people have contributed to wrapping FLINT in Sage and
debugging, including Mike Hansen, Jean-Pierre Flori, Burcin Erocal, Robert
Bradshaw, Martin Albrecht, Sebastian Pancratz, Fredrik Johansson, Jeroen
Demeyer and Leif Lionhardy, amongst others.

Some code (notably \code{longlong.h} and \code{clz_tab.c}) has been used from
the GMP library, whose main author is Torbjorn Granlund.

FLINT 2 was a complete rewrite from scratch which began in about 2010.
