Instructions on installing flint 2
----------------------------------

FLINT 2 follows a standard format for installation:

./configure
make
make check
make install

However, this assumes that MPIR and MPFR are already installed in the default
search path of your compiler (e.g. /usr/include/ and /usr/lib/). If these
libraries are not in such location you must specify where they are by passing
their location to configure `--with-mpir=ABSOLUTE_PATH` for MPIR and
`--with-mpfr=ABSOLUTE_PATH` for MPFR.

The configure script also assumes you wish to install FLINT 2 at the prefix
/usr/local. If not you must pass the prefix (the directory containing lib and
include subdirectories into which FLINT will be installed) to configure with
the option `--prefix=PATH`.

A complete example of a custom configuration command would be

./configure --with-mpir=/home/user1/mpir-2.1.1/ --with-mpfr=/usr --prefix=/usr

Note that the FLINT configure system can handle MPIR/MPFR as installed (in lib
and include dirs) at some location, or as source builds (built from source and
not installed). Though, to run the FLINT tests, MPIR/MPFR needs to be
properly installed.

For further configure and make options, please refer to the FLINT 2 documentation.
