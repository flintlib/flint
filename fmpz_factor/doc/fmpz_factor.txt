    Factoring integers 

    An integer may be represented in factored form using the 
    \code{fmpz_factor_t} data structure. This consists of two \code{fmpz} 
    vectors representing bases and exponents, respectively. Canonically, 
    the bases will be prime numbers sorted in ascending order and the 
    exponents will be positive.

    A separate \code{int} field holds the sign, which may be $-1$, $0$ or $1$.

*******************************************************************************

void fmpz_factor_init(fmpz_factor_t factor)

    Initialises an \code{fmpz_factor_t} structure.

void fmpz_factor_clear(fmpz_factor_t factor)

    Clears an \code{fmpz_factor_t} structure.

void _fmpz_factor_append_ui(fmpz_factor_t factor, mp_limb_t p, ulong exp)

    Append a factor $p$ to the given exponent to the 
    \code{fmpz_factor_t} structure \code{factor}.

void _fmpz_factor_append(fmpz_factor_t factor, fmpz_t p, ulong exp)

    Append a factor $p$ to the given exponent to the 
    \code{fmpz_factor_t} structure \code{factor}.

void fmpz_factor(fmpz_factor_t factor, const fmpz_t n)

    Factors $n$ into prime numbers. If $n$ is zero or negative, the
    sign field of the \code{factor} object will be set accordingly.

    This currently only uses trial division, falling back to \code{n_factor()}
    as soon as the number shrinks to a single limb.

void fmpz_factor_si(fmpz_factor_t factor, slong n)

    Like \code{fmpz_factor}, but takes a machine integer $n$ as input.

int fmpz_factor_trial_range(fmpz_factor_t factor, const fmpz_t n, 
                                       ulong start, ulong num_primes)

    Factors $n$ into prime factors using trial division. If $n$ is 
    zero or negative, the sign field of the \code{factor} object will be 
    set accordingly.

    The algorithm starts with the given start index in the \code{flint_primes}
    table and uses at most \code{num_primes} primes from that point. 

    The function returns 1 if $n$ is completely factored, otherwise it returns
    $0$.

void fmpz_factor_refine(fmpz_factor_t res, const fmpz_factor_t f)

    Attempts to improve a partial factorization of an integer by "refining"
    the factorization \code{f} to a more complete factorization \code{res}
    whose bases are pairwise relatively prime.

    This function does not require its input to be in canonical form,
    nor does it guarantee that the resulting factorization will be canonical.

void fmpz_factor_expand_iterative(fmpz_t n, const fmpz_factor_t factor)

    Evaluates an integer in factored form back to an \code{fmpz_t}.

    This currently exponentiates the bases separately and multiplies
    them together one by one, although much more efficient algorithms
    exist. 

int fmpz_factor_pp1(fmpz_t factor, const fmpz_t n, 
                                             ulong B1, ulong B2_sqrt, ulong c)

    Use Williams' $p + 1$ method to factor $n$, using a prime bound in
    stage 1 of \code{B1} and a prime limit in stage 2 of at least the square 
    of \code{B2_sqrt}. If a factor is found, the function returns $1$ and 
    \code{factor} is set to the factor that is found. Otherwise, the function 
    returns $0$.

    The value $c$ should be a random value greater than $2$. Successive 
    calls to the function with different values of $c$ give additional 
    chances to factor $n$ with roughly exponentially decaying probability 
    of finding a factor which has been missed (if $p+1$ or $p-1$ is not
    smooth for any prime factors $p$ of $n$ then the function will
    not ever succeed).

int fmpz_factor_pollard_brent_single(fmpz_t p_factor, fmpz_t n_in, fmpz_t yi, 
                                     fmpz_t ai, mp_limb_t max_iters)

    Pollard Rho algorithm for integer factorization. Assumes that the $n$ is
    not prime. $factor$ is set as the factor if found. Takes as input the initial
    value $y$, to start polynomial evaluation and $a$, the constant of the polynomial
    used. It is not assured that the factor found will be prime. Does not compute 
    the complete factorization, just one factor. Returns the number of limbs of 
    factor if factorization is successfull (non trivial factor is found), else returns 0. 

    $max_iters$ is the number of iterations tried in process of finding the cycle. 
    If the algorithm fails to find a non trivial factor in one call, it tries again 
    (this time with a different set of random values). 
    
int fmpz_factor_pollard_brent(fmpz_t factor, flint_rand_t state, fmpz_t n, 
                              mp_limb_t max_tries, mp_limb_t max_iters)

    Pollard Rho algorithm for integer factorization. Assumes that the $n$ is
    not prime. $factor$ is set as the factor if found. It is not assured that the 
    factor found will be prime. Does not compute the complete factorization, 
    just one factor. Returns the number of limbs of factor if factorization is 
    successfull (non trivial factor is found), else returns 0. 

    $max_iters$ is the number of iterations tried in process of finding the cycle. 
    If the algorithm fails to find a non trivial factor in one call, it tries again 
    (this time with a different set of random values). This process is repeated a 
    maximum of $max_tries$ times. 

    The algorithm used is a modification of the original Pollard Rho algorithm,
    suggested by Richard Brent. It can be found in the paper availible at
    http://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~brent/pd/rpb051i.pdf
