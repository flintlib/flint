                                                              mp_bitcnt_t bits)

    Sets the entries of \code{mat} to random signed integers whose 
    absolute values have a random number of bits up to the given number 
    of bits inclusive.

                                                              mp_bitcnt_t bits)

    Sets \code{mat} to be a random \emph{integer relations} matrix, with 
    signed entries up to the given number of bits.

    The number of columns of \code{mat} must be equal to one more than 
    the number of rows. The format of the matrix is a set of random integers 
    in the left hand column and an identity matrix in the remaining square 
    submatrix.

void fmpz_mat_randsimdioph(fmpz_mat_t mat, flint_rand_t state, 
                                           mp_bitcnt_t bits, mp_bitcnt_t bits2)

    Sets \code{mat} to a random \emph{simultaneous diophantine} matrix.

    The matrix must be square. The top left entry is set to \code{2^bits2}. 
    The remainder of that row is then set to signed random integers of the 
    given number of binary bits. The remainder of the first column is zero. 
    Running down the rest of the diagonal are the values \code{2^bits} with 
    all remaining entries zero.

void fmpz_mat_randntrulike(fmpz_mat_t mat, flint_rand_t state, 
                                                     mp_bitcnt_t bits, ulong q)

    Sets a square matrix \emph{mat} of even dimension to a random 
    \emph{NTRU like} matrix.

    The matrix is broken into four square submatrices. The top left submatrix
    is set to the identity. The bottom left submatrix is set to the zero 
    matrix. The bottom right submatrix is set to $q$ times the identity matrix.
    Finally the top right submatrix has the following format. A random vector
    $h$ of length $r/2$ is created, with random signed entries of the given 
    number of bits. Then entry $(i, j)$ of the submatrix is set to 
    $h[i + j \bmod{r/2}]$. 

void fmpz_mat_randntrulike2(fmpz_mat_t mat, flint_rand_t state, 
                                                     mp_bitcnt_t bits, ulong q)

    Sets a square matrix mat of even dimension to a random 
    \emph{NTRU like} matrix.

    The matrix is broken into four square submatrices. The top left submatrix
    is set to $q$ times the identity matrix. The top right submatrix is set to 
    the zero matrix. The bottom right submatrix is set to the identity matrix.
    Finally the bottom left submatrix has the following format. A random vector
    $h$ of length $r/2$ is created, with random signed entries of the given 
    number of bits. Then entry $(i, j)$ of the submatrix is set to 
    $h[i + j \bmod{r/2}]$.

void fmpz_mat_randajtai(fmpz_mat_t mat, flint_rand_t state, double alpha)

    Sets a square matrix mat to a random \emph{ajtai} matrix. The diagonal 
    entries $(i, i)$ are set to a random entry in the range $[1, 2^{b-1}]$ 
    inclusive where $b = \floor{(2 r - i)^\alpha}$ for some double parameter 
    $\alpha$. The entries below the diagonal in column $i$ are set to a 
    random entry in the range $(-2^b + 1, 2^b - 1)$ whilst the entries to 
    the right of the diagonal in row $i$ are set to zero. 

int fmpz_mat_randpermdiag(fmpz_mat_t mat, flint_rand_t state, 
                                                     const fmpz * diag, long n)

    Sets \emph{mat} to a random permutation of the rows and columns of a
    given diagonal matrix. The diagonal matrix is specified in the form of
    an array of the n initial entries on the main diagonal.

    The return value is $0$ or $1$ depending on whether the permutation is
    even or odd.

void fmpz_mat_randrank(fmpz_mat_t mat, flint_rand_t state, long rank, 
                                                              mp_bitcnt_t bits)

    Sets \emph{mat} to a random sparse matrix with the given rank, 
    having exactly as many nonzero elements as the rank, with the 
    nonzero elements being random integers of the given bit size.

    The matrix can be transformed into a dense matrix with unchanged
    rank by subsequently calling \code{fmpz_mat_randops}.

void fmpz_mat_randdet(fmpz_mat_t mat, flint_rand_t state, const fmpz_t det)

    Sets \code{mat} to a random sparse matrix with minimal number of
    nonzero entries such that its determinant has the given value.

    Note that the matrix will be zero if \code{det} is zero.  
    In order to generate a non-zero singular matrix, the function 
    \code{fmpz_mat_randrank()} can be used.

    The matrix can be transformed into a dense matrix with unchanged
    determinant by subsequently calling \code{fmpz_mat_randops}.

void fmpz_mat_randops(fmpz_mat_t mat, flint_rand_t state, long count)

    Randomises \code{mat} by performing elementary row or column operations.
    More precisely, at most \code{count} random additions or subtractions of
    distinct rows and columns will be performed. This leaves the rank
    (and for square matrices, determinant) unchanged.

*******************************************************************************

    Basic assignment and manipulation

*******************************************************************************

void fmpz_mat_set(fmpz_mat_t mat1, fmpz_mat_t mat2)

    Sets \code{mat1} to a copy of \code{mat2}. The dimensions of 
    \code{mat1} and \code{mat2} must be the same.

void fmpz_mat_init_set(fmpz_mat_t mat, fmpz_mat_t src)

    Initialises the matrix \code{mat} to the same size as \code{src} and 
    sets it to a copy of \code{src}.

void fmpz_mat_swap(fmpz_mat_t mat1, fmpz_mat_t mat2)

    Swaps two matrices. The dimensions of \code{mat1} and \code{mat2} 
    are allowed to be different.

fmpz * fmpz_mat_entry(fmpz_mat_t mat, long i, long j)

    Returns a reference to the entry of \code{mat} at row $i$ and column $j$.
    This reference can be passed as an input or output variable to any
    function in the \code{fmpz} module for direct manipulation.

    Both $i$ and $j$ must not exceed the dimensions of the matrix.

    This function is implemented as a macro.

void fmpz_mat_zero(fmpz_mat_t mat)

    Sets all entries of \code{mat} to 0.

    Sets the entries \code{Amod} to the entries of \code{A} reduced
    by the modulus of \code{Amod}.


*******************************************************************************

    Input and output

*******************************************************************************

int fmpz_mat_fprint(FILE * file, const fmpz_mat_t mat)

    Prints the given matrix to the stream \code{file}.  The format is 
    the number of rows, a space, the number of columns, two spaces, then 
    a space separated list of coefficients, one row after the other.

    In case of success, returns a positive value;  otherwise, returns 
    a non-positive value.

int fmpz_mat_fprint_pretty(FILE * file, const fmpz_mat_t mat)

    Prints the given matrix to the stream \code{file}.  The format is an 
    opening square bracket then on each line a row of the matrix, followed 
    by a closing square bracket. Each row is written as an opening square 
    bracket followed by a space separated list of coefficients followed 
    by a closing square bracket.

    In case of success, returns a positive value;  otherwise, returns 
    a non-positive value.

int fmpz_mat_print(const fmpz_mat_t mat)

    Prints the given matrix to the stream \code{file}.  For further 
    details, see \code{fmpz_mat_fprint()}.

int fmpz_mat_print_pretty(const fmpz_mat_t mat)

    Prints the given matrix to \code{stdout}.  For further details, 
    see \code{fmpz_mat_fprint_pretty()}.

*******************************************************************************

    Comparison

*******************************************************************************

int fmpz_mat_equal(fmpz_mat_t mat1, fmpz_mat_t mat2)

    Returns nonzero if \code{mat1} and \code{mat2} have the same 
    dimensions and entries, and zero otherwise.

*******************************************************************************

    Transpose

*******************************************************************************

void fmpz_mat_transpose(fmpz_mat_t B, const fmpz_mat_t A)

    Sets $B$ to $A^T$, the transpose of $A$. Dimensions must be compatible.
    $A$ and $B$ are allowed to be the same object if $A$ is a square matrix.

*******************************************************************************

    Multiplication

*******************************************************************************

void fmpz_mat_mul(fmpz_mat_t C, const fmpz_mat_t A, const fmpz_mat_t B)

    Sets $C$ to the matrix product $A B$. The matrices must have
    compatible dimensions for matrix multiplication. Aliasing
    is allowed.

    This function automatically switches between classical and
    multimodular multiplication, based on a heuristic comparison of
    the dimensions and entry sizes.

void fmpz_mat_mul_classical(fmpz_mat_t C, 
                                        const fmpz_mat_t A, const fmpz_mat_t B)

    Sets $C$ to the matrix product $A B$ computed using the classical
    algorithm.

    The matrices must have compatible dimensions for matrix multiplication.
    No aliasing between $C$ and $A$ or $C$ and $B$ is allowed.

void _fmpz_mat_mul_multi_mod(fmpz_mat_t C, fmpz_mat_t A, fmpz_mat_t B, 
                                                                     long bits)

void fmpz_mat_mul_multi_mod(fmpz_mat_t C, fmpz_mat_t A, fmpz_mat_t B)

    Sets $C$ to the matrix product $A B$ computed using a multimodular 
    algorithm. $C$ is computed modulo several small prime numbers
    and reconstructed using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. This becomes 
    more efficient for larger matrices with smaller entries.

    The \code{bits} parameter is a bound for the bit size of largest 
    element of $C$, or twice the absolute value of the largest element 
    if any elements of $C$ are negative.  The function 
    \code{fmpz_mat_mul_multi_mod} calculates a rigorous but
    sometimes pessimistic bound automatically.

    The matrices must have compatible dimensions for matrix multiplication.
    No aliasing between $C$ and $A$ or $C$ and $B$ is allowed.

*******************************************************************************

    Inverse

*******************************************************************************

void fmpz_mat_inv(fmpz_mat_t B, fmpz_t d, const fmpz_mat_t A)

    Sets \code{(B, d)} to the inverse matrix of the square matrix $A$,
    i.e.\ computes an integer matrix $B$ and an integer $d$ such
    that $A B = B A = d I$, the identity matrix.

    If $A$ is singular, $d$ will be set to zero and the value of 
    $B$ will be undefined.
    In general, \code{(B, d)} will not be reduced to lowest terms.
    $A$ and $B$ are allowed to be the same object.

*******************************************************************************

    Determinant

*******************************************************************************

void fmpz_mat_det(fmpz_t det, const fmpz_mat_t A)

    Sets \code{det} to the determinant of the square matrix $A$.
    This function automatically chooses between \code{fmpz_mat_det_cofactor},
    \code{fmpz_mat_det_bareiss} and \code{fmpz_mat_det_multi_mod}
    (with \code{proved} = 1), depending on the size of the matrix.

    The matrix of dimension $0 \times 0$ is defined to have determinant 1.

void fmpz_mat_det_cofactor(fmpz_t det, const fmpz_mat_t A)

    Sets \code{det} to the determinant of the square matrix $A$
    computed using direct cofactor expansion. This function only
    supports matrices up to size $4 \times 4$.

void fmpz_mat_det_bareiss(fmpz_t det, const fmpz_mat_t A)

    Sets \code{det} to the determinant of the square matrix $A$
    computed using the Bareiss algorithm. A copy of the input matrix is
    row reduced using fraction-free Gaussian elimination, and the
    determinant is read off from the last element on the main
    diagonal.

void fmpz_mat_det_multi_mod(fmpz_t det, const fmpz_mat_t A, int proved)

    Sets \code{det} to the determinant of the square matrix $A$
    (if \code{proved} = 1), or a probabilistic value for the
    determinant (\code{proved} = 0), computed using a multimodular
    algorithm.

    The determinant is computed modulo several small primes and
    reconstructed using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
    With \code{proved} = 1, sufficiently many primes are chosen
    to satisfy the bound computed by \code{fmpz_mat_det_bound}.
    With \code{proved} = 0, the determinant is considered determined
    if it remains unchanged modulo several consecutive primes
    (currently if their product exceeds $2^{100}$).

void fmpz_mat_det_bound(fmpz_t bound, const fmpz_mat_t A)

    Sets \code{bound} to a nonnegative integer $B$ such that
    $|\det(A)| \le B$. Assumes $A$ to be a square matrix.
    The bound is computed from the Hadamard inequality
    $|\det(A)| \le \prod \|a_i\|_2$ where the product is taken
    over the rows $a_i$ of $A$.

*******************************************************************************

    Rank

*******************************************************************************

long fmpz_mat_rank(const fmpz_mat_t A)

    Returns the rank, that is, the number of linearly independent columns
    (equivalently, rows), of $A$. The rank is computed by row reducing
    a copy of $A$.

*******************************************************************************

    Solving

*******************************************************************************

void fmpz_mat_solve(fmpz * x, fmpz_t den, const fmpz_mat_t A, const fmpz * b)

    Solves $A x = b$ for the rational vector $x$, where $A$ is an 
    $m$-by-$m$ integer matrix and $b$ is an integer vector of length $m$.

    More precisely, computes an integer vector $x$ and an integer 
    \code{den} such that \code{A * x = den b}. \code{(x, den)} will not 
    generally be reduced to lowest terms. If $A$ is singular, \code{den} 
    will be set to zero and $x$ will be undefined.

    $x$ and $b$ are not permitted to be aliased.

void fmpz_mat_solve_mat(fmpz_mat_t X, fmpz_t den, 
                                        const fmpz_mat_t A, const fmpz_mat_t B)

    Solves $A X = B$ for the rational matrix $m$-by-$n$ matrix $X$, 
    where $A$ is an $m$-by-$m$ integer matrix and $B$ is an $m$-by-$n$ 
    integer matrix. Equivalently, solves $A x = b$ for every respective 
    column vector $x$ in $X$ and $b$ in $B$.

    More precisely, computes an integer matrix $X$ and an integer 
    \code{den} such that \code{A * X = den B}. \code{(X, den)} will 
    not generally be reduced to lowest terms. If $A$ is singular, 
    \code{den} will be set to zero and $x$ will be undefined.

    $X$ and $B$ are not permitted to be aliased.

void _fmpz_mat_solve_2x2(fmpz * x, fmpz_t den, fmpz ** const a, const fmpz * b)

void _fmpz_mat_solve_3x3(fmpz * x, fmpz_t den, fmpz ** const a, const fmpz * b)

    Solves \code{A * x/den = b} using Cramer's rule.

void _fmpz_mat_solve_fflu(fmpz * x, fmpz_t den, const fmpz_mat_t A, 
                          const fmpz * b)

    Solves \code{A * x/den = b} for general square matrix $A$ by first 
    computing the fraction-free $LU$ decomposition and then calling
    \code{_fmpz_mat_solve_fflu_precomp()}.

void _fmpz_mat_solve_fflu_precomp(fmpz * b, fmpz ** const a, long n)

    Uses forward/back substitution to set $b$ to the solution $x$ of 
    \code{A * x/den = b}, where $a$ points to the rows of a precomputed 
    fraction-free $LU$ decomposition of $A$, as generated by 
    \code{_fmpz_mat_rowreduce}.

    The rows are assumed to be sorted by the order of the pivots.
    If pivoting has occurred, the caller must ensure that the vector $b$ 
    is in the same order.

long _fmpz_mat_rowreduce(fmpz_mat_t mat, int options)

    Row reduces the matrix in-place using fraction-free Gaussian
    elimination. The number of rows $m$ and columns $n$ may be arbitrary.

    This function effectively implements the algorithms FFGE, FFGJ and FFLU
    given in~\citep{NakTurWil1997}, but with pivoting. The \code{options} 
    parameter is a bitfield which may be set to any combination of the 
    following flags; use \code{options = 0} to disable all, resulting in FFLU:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item \code{ROWREDUCE_FAST_ABORT}

        If set, the function immediately aborts and returns $0$ when (if) the
        matrix is detected to be rank-deficient (singular). In this event,
        the state of the matrix will be undefined.

    \item \code{ROWREDUCE_FULL}

        If set, performs fraction-free Gauss-Jordan elimination (FFGJ), 
        i.e.\ eliminates the elements above each pivot element as well as 
        those below. If not set, regular Gaussian elimination is performed 
        and only the elements below pivots are eliminated.

    \item \code{ROWREDUCE_CLEAR_LOWER}

        If set, clears (i.e.\ zeros) elements below the pivots (FFGE). If not
        set, the output becomes the fraction-free $LU$ decomposition of the
        matrix with $L$ in the lower triangular part.

    \end{itemize}

    Pivoting (to avoid division by zero entries) is performed by permuting
    the vector of row pointers in-place. The matrix entries themselves
    retain their original order in memory.

    The return value $r$ is the rank of the matrix, multiplied by a sign
    indicating the parity of row interchanges. If $r = 0$, the matrix has rank
    zero, unless \code{ROWREDUCE_FAST_ABORT} is set, in which case $r = 0$ 
    indicates any deficient rank. Otherwise, the leading nonzero entries of
    $a[0], a[1], \dotsc, a[\abs{r}-1]$ will point to the successive pivot 
    elements. If $\abs{r} = m = n$, the determinant of the matrix is given 
    by $\sgn(r) \times a\bigl[\abs{r}-1\bigr]\bigl[\abs{r}-1\bigr]$.
