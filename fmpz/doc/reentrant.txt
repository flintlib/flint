link/fmpz_reentrant.c <-- fmpz.c

   If this version of fmpz.c is used (e.g. if the configure option 
   \code{--reentrant} is used), then the fmpz module is threadsafe, though 
   a little slower when using integers which are larger than 
   \code{FLINT_BITS - 2} bits.

fmpz

   an fmpz is implemented as a long. When its second most significant bit 
   is 0 the fmpz represents an ordinary signed long integer whose absolute
   value is at most FLINT_BITS - 2 bits.

   When the second most significant bit is 1 then the value represents a 
   pointer (the pointer is shifted right 2 bits and the second msb is set
   to 1 - this relies on the fact that malloc always allocates memory
   blocks on a 4 or 8 byte boundary).

fmpz_t
  
   an array of length 1 of fmpz's. This is used to pass fmpz's around by
   reference without fuss, similar to the way mpz_t's work.

COEFF_MAX
 
   the largest (positive) value an fmpz can be if just a long

COEFF_MIN
 
   the smallest (negative) value an fmpz can be if just a long

fmpz PTR_TO_COEFF(__mpz_struct * ptr)

   a macro to convert an mpz_t (or more generally any __mpz_struct *) to an 
   fmpz (shifts the pointer right by 2 and sets the second most significant 
   bit). 

__mpz_struct * COEFF_TO_PTR(fmpz f)

   a macro to convert an fmpz which represents a pointer into an actual 
   pointer to an __mpz_struct (i.e. to an mpz_t)

int COEFF_IS_MPZ(fmpz f)

   a macro which returns 1 if f represents an mpz_t, otherwise 0 is returned.

__mpz_struct * _fmpz_new_mpz(void)

   initialises a new mpz_t and returns a pointer to it. This is only used 
   internally.

void _fmpz_clear_mpz(fmpz f)

   clears the mpz_t "pointed to" by the fmpz f. This is only used internally.

void _fmpz_cleanup_mpz_content()

   this function does nothing in the reentrant version of fmpz.

void _fmpz_cleanup()

   this function does nothing in the reentrant version of fmpz.

__mpz_struct * _fmpz_promote(fmpz_t f)

   if f doesn't represent an mpz_t, initialise one and associate it to f.

__mpz_struct * _fmpz_promote_val(fmpz_t f)

   if f doesn't represent an mpz_t, initialise one and associate it to f, but
   preserve the value of f.

void _fmpz_demote(fmpz_t f)

   if f represents an mpz_t clear it and make f just represent a long.

void _fmpz_demote_val(fmpz_t f)

   if f represents an mpz_t and its value will fit in a long, preserve the 
   value in f which we make to represent a long, and clear the mpz_t.
