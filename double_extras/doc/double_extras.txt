double d_lambertw(double x)

    Computes the principal branch of the Lambert W function, solving
    the equation $x = W(x) \exp(W(x))$. If $x < -1/e$, the solution is
    complex, and NaN is returned.

    Depending on the magnitude of $x$, we start from a piecewise rational
    approximation or a zeroth-order truncation of the asymptotic expansion
    at infinity, and perform 0, 1 or 2 iterations with Halley's
    method to obtain full accuracy.

    A test of $10^7$ random inputs showed a maximum relative error smaller
    than 0.95 times \code{DBL_EPSILON} ($2^{-52}$) for positive $x$.
    Accuracy for negative $x$ is slightly worse, and can grow to
    about 10 times \code{DBL_EPSILON} close to $-1/e$.
    However, accuracy may be worse depending on compiler flags and
    the accuracy of the system libm functions.
